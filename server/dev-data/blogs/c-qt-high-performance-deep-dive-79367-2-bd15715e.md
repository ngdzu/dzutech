# C++/Qt High Performance: Deep Dive 79367-2


_Topic: C++ / Qt â€” High Performance Computing_


In this post we explore practical strategies to squeeze more performance from C++ applications using the Qt framework.


## profiling workflows with perf / Instruments and Qt Creator


A key observation when working on profiling workflows with perf / Instruments and Qt Creator is to measure before optimizing: profile hotspots and focus efforts where they matter. Qt provides useful abstractions, but be mindful of implicit allocations; using move semantics and reserving capacity can remove surprises. Real-world systems often have non-obvious bottlenecks: batching, avoiding virtual calls in hot paths, and keeping data compact helps.

    // process in-place to avoid extra allocations
    for (int &v : data) { v = heavyCompute(v); }
  }
  static int heavyCompute(int x) { return x * x; }
};

void scheduleWork(const QVector<int>& inputs) {
  QThreadPool &pool = *QThreadPool::globalInstance();
  for (int i = 0; i < inputs.size(); i += 1024) {

    for (int j = i; j < end; ++j) slice.append(inputs[j]);
    pool.start(new Work(std::move(slice)));
  }
