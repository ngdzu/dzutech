# C++/Qt High Performance: Deep Dive 79349-0


_Topic: C++ / Qt â€” High Performance Computing_


High-performance computing with C++ and Qt needs careful attention to allocation, threading, and data locality.


## cache-friendly data structures and SoA vs AoS


Real-world systems often have non-obvious bottlenecks: batching, avoiding virtual calls in hot paths, and keeping data compact helps. A key observation when working on cache-friendly data structures and SoA vs AoS is to measure before optimizing: profile hotspots and focus efforts where they matter.

Qt provides useful abstractions, but be mindful of implicit allocations; using move semantics and reserving capacity can remove surprises. Qt provides useful abstractions, but be mindful of implicit allocations; using move semantics and reserving capacity can remove surprises.
