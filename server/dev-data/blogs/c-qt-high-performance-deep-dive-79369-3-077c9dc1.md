# C++/Qt High Performance: Deep Dive 79369-3


_Topic: C++ / Qt — High Performance Computing_


We walk through measurement, optimization, and Qt-specific tips for building high-throughput C++ applications.


## IO strategies: asynchronous IO, zero-copy where possible


A key observation when working on IO strategies: asynchronous IO, zero-copy where possible is to measure before optimizing: profile hotspots and focus efforts where they matter. Qt provides useful abstractions, but be mindful of implicit allocations; using move semantics and reserving capacity can remove surprises. Real-world systems often have non-obvious bottlenecks: batching, avoiding virtual calls in hot paths, and keeping data compact helps.
