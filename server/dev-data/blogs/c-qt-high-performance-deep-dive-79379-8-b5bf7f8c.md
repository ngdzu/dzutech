# C++/Qt High Performance: Deep Dive 79379-8


_Topic: C++ / Qt â€” High Performance Computing_


High-performance computing with C++ and Qt needs careful attention to allocation, threading, and data locality.


## lock-free programming and QAtomic operations


Real-world systems often have non-obvious bottlenecks: batching, avoiding virtual calls in hot paths, and keeping data compact helps. Real-world systems often have non-obvious bottlenecks: batching, avoiding virtual calls in hot paths, and keeping data compact helps.

A key observation when working on lock-free programming and QAtomic operations is to measure before optimizing: profile hotspots and focus efforts where they matter. Qt provides useful abstractions, but be mindful of implicit allocations; using move semantics and reserving capacity can remove surprises.
