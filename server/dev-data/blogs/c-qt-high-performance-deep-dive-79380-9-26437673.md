# C++/Qt High Performance: Deep Dive 79380-9


_Topic: C++ / Qt â€” High Performance Computing_


High-performance computing with C++ and Qt needs careful attention to allocation, threading, and data locality.


## Qt containers vs std::vector performance tradeoffs


A key observation when working on Qt containers vs std::vector performance tradeoffs is to measure before optimizing: profile hotspots and focus efforts where they matter.

Qt provides useful abstractions, but be mindful of implicit allocations; using move semantics and reserving capacity can remove surprises.
